To submit a project proposal, follow these steps:

1. **Review the Proposal Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with the project proposal guidelines provided on the ASoC website. These guidelines will help you structure your proposal and ensure that it includes all the necessary information.

   **Proposal Guidelines:**
   - Clearly state the goals and objectives of the project.
   - Define the scope and expected outcomes of the project.
   - Specify the technologies and tools involved.
   - Break down the project into manageable tasks that mentees can work on.
   - Provide resources, references, and documentation to support the project.
   - Emphasize the mentor's availability and willingness to guide mentees throughout the project.
   - Highlight the uniqueness and value of the project, ensuring it offers mentees an enriching and impactful experience.
   - Explain how the project aligns with the program's objectives and fosters learning and growth.

2. **Prepare Your Proposal**: Craft a comprehensive project proposal that addresses the guidelines and includes the required details. Make sure to present your project in a clear and organized manner, allowing the review team to understand its potential and value.

3. **Submit Your Proposal**: Once your project proposal is ready, submit it through [Project Proposal form](#project-proposal-form). Make sure to double-check that you have included all the necessary details and have expressed your enthusiasm for mentoring mentees or working on the project.

Submitting a project proposal allows you to shape the ASoC program and contribute to the growth of aspiring open-source contributors. The ASoC team will review and evaluate project proposals to ensure they align with the program's objectives and provide a meaningful learning experience for mentees. Selected projects will be included in the list of projects available for mentees to choose from, providing them with an opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects and gain valuable experience.

Please note that the availability of projects is subject to change as we strive to offer a dynamic and diverse range of opportunities. We encourage you to regularly check the Projects page for updates and new additions.

If you have any questions or need further assistance regarding the projects or project proposal submission, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact-us).

**Note:** All projects, whether predefined or proposed, need to be open-source and offer mentees a valuable learning experience. We look forward to your innovative project proposals and your active participation in the ASoC program!
